# Public-Chatroom
A chatroom I made for the OCR programming project

Usage:
Firstly, ensure the external libraries are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt)\
Modify the public and private RSA key files (since the ones here can't be trusted)\
To run a server, simply use python server.py\
To run a client, simply run python client.py
